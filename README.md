You can observe the movement, the pay, the performance of the vehicles, via the interactive map and graphs. The city will be divided into zones, diversified by the number of businesses and citizens in them, with citizens being able to move from one zone to another.

For each area, the average salary, the number of people in businesses and transport congestion will be calculated, all this over a period of one/a few weeks.
