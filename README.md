You can observe the movement, the pay, the congestion of the transport lines, via the interactive map and graphs. The city will be divided into 5 zones, diversified by the number of businesses and citizens in them, with citizens being able to move from one zone to another, in order to reach their job's location or go back home after work.
The Businesses will hire and fire people during the simulation, and they will be distributed across the map.
